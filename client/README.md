# frontend of Repos from Github

first of all, hope you like it. It has some of the 90s vibe, which was unintentional but came up on the way.

there are some points which could be as well tackled in the future, so I'll past'em here (hoping I'll be back):

- service worker
- optimizing production bundle
- spinner/loader
- make username and date to be user input
